## Overview

Centipede is a fun arcade game with simple and easy to use controls where a player moves left to right along the bottom of the screen while attacking the enemy centipede.

The game gets progressively harder as the centipede moves faster at higher levels and drops barriers as part of the centipede splits off.

This game is inspired by a classic arcade game that I grew up playing with the same name.
