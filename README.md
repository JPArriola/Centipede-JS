## Overview

Defending Bikini Bottom is a fun arcade game with simple and easy to use controls where a player moves Gary the Snail left to right along the bottom of the screen while attacking the enemy Planktons.

The game gets progressively harder as the Planktons fire faster at higher levels.

This game is inspired by a classic arcade game that I grew up playing called Space Invaders.
